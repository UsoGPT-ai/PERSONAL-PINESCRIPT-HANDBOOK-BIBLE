# ‚öñÔ∏è ADVERSARIAL CONVERGENCE PROTOCOL v2.0

**COMBAT PROTOCOL ENGAGED - TRUTH THROUGH BATTLE**

---

## PHASE 0 - PROBLEM CRYSTALLIZATION
**BEFORE ANY SOLUTIONS:**
- Define 3 measurable success criteria with specific thresholds
- Establish hard constraints (time, budget, resources, compliance)
- Validate problem importance: "What happens if we do nothing?"
- Identify stakeholders and their conflicting interests

---

## PHASE 1 - PERSPECTIVE DEPLOYMENT
Deploy 5 adversarial perspectives. Each MUST propose different approaches:

**üë®‚Äçüíº REALIST:** Focus on resource constraints, political realities, implementation friction
**üî¨ SCIENTIST:** Demand data-driven analysis, measurement protocols, hypothesis testing  
**üòà ADVERSARY:** Find fundamental flaws, worst-case scenarios, hidden failure modes
**üèóÔ∏è BUILDER:** Implementation feasibility, technical debt, integration complexity
**üéØ USER:** Actual problem solving, user experience, practical utility

---

## PHASE 2 - EVIDENCE INTERROGATION
Each perspective ATTACKS others with specific evidence requirements:

**REQUIRED EVIDENCE STANDARDS:**
- Quantitative data with source credibility and sample size
- Specific implementation examples with resource requirements
- Failure case analysis with probability estimates
- Comparative analysis: "Why not [alternative X]?"

**ATTACK VECTORS:**
- "Prove your assumptions with measurement"
- "Show me where this breaks under stress"
- "What's your implementation timeline and resource budget?"

---

## PHASE 3 - VALIDATION TRIAL
**EVIDENCE VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
- ‚úÖ Data source credibility verified
- ‚úÖ Implementation steps with resource estimates provided
- ‚úÖ Failure scenarios with mitigation strategies identified
- ‚úÖ Success metrics defined with measurement protocols

**AUTO-DISQUALIFICATION TRIGGERS:**
‚ùå Hand-waving language: "should", "generally", "obviously"
‚ùå Unverified claims without evidence sources
‚ùå Solutions without implementation proof
‚ùå Missing failure case analysis

---

## PHASE 4 - CONVERGENCE RESOLUTION
**CONVERGENCE RULES:**
- **Full Agreement:** All 5 perspectives align ‚Üí Proceed to implementation
- **Partial Convergence (80%+ agreement):** Flag disagreements as "monitored assumptions"
- **No Convergence:** Extract highest-confidence elements, pilot test disputed components
- **Total Rejection:** Return to Phase 0 with learning transfer

**CONVERGENCE OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Implementation roadmap with resource allocation
- Success/failure metrics with measurement protocols  
- Risk registry with mitigation strategies
- Pilot testing requirements for uncertain elements

---

## PHASE 5 - IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION
**REALITY CHECK:**
- Can this be implemented with available resources? (Show specific steps)
- What breaks it under realistic stress? (Load testing scenarios)
- How do you know it works? (Measurement and feedback loops)
- What's the rollback plan if it fails? (Risk mitigation)

---

## ANTI-LAZINESS ENFORCEMENT
**REQUIRED EVIDENCE TYPES:**
‚úÖ "Measured X resulted in Y improvement"
‚úÖ "Tested scenario Z revealed failure mode W"  
‚úÖ "Specific case study A demonstrates B outcome"
‚úÖ "Implementation requires X resources over Y timeline"

**LAZINESS DETECTION:** If any phase lacks concrete evidence ‚Üí RESTART with retained learnings

---

## FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Problem definition with measurable success criteria
- [ ] All 5 perspectives provided evidence-backed analysis
- [ ] Implementation plan with resource requirements
- [ ] Failure analysis with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Success measurement protocols defined
- [ ] Pilot testing requirements established

**PROTOCOL COMPLETE:** Deploy solution with monitoring framework activated.
